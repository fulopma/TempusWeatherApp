## Tempus Open Source Project
Curious about the weather? Is it unusually hot or cold; rain or dry? Using the open-meteo API, Tempus can answer by looking what the weather in terms of temperature and precipation was like given the same day at the location going back to 1950.
Feel free to suggest or contribute new features.
